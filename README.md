# Next AI Draw.io

A next.js web application that integrates AI capabilities with draw.io diagrams. This app allows you to create, modify, and enhance diagrams through natural language commands and AI-assisted visualization.

Demo site: [https://next-ai-draw-io.vercel.app/](https://next-ai-draw-io.vercel.app/)

## Features

-   **LLM-Powered Diagram Creation**: Leverage Large Language Models to create and manipulate draw.io diagrams directly through natural language commands
-   **Image-Based Diagram Replication**: Upload existing diagrams or images and have the AI replicate and enhance them automatically
-   **Diagram History**: Comprehensive version control that tracks all changes, allowing you to view and restore previous versions of your diagrams before the AI editing.
-   **Interactive Chat Interface**: Communicate with AI to refine your diagrams in real-time
-   **Smart Editing**: Modify existing diagrams using simple text prompts

## How It Works

The application uses the following technologies:

-   **Next.js**: For the frontend framework and routing
-   **@ai-sdk/react**: For the chat interface and AI interactions
-   **react-drawio**: For diagram representation and manipulation

Diagrams are represented as XML that can be rendered in draw.io. The AI processes your commands and generates or modifies this XML accordingly.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DayuanJiang/next-ai-draw-io
cd next-ai-draw-io
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
# Add any other required environment variables
```

4. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## Deployment

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new) from the creators of Next.js.
